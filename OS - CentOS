			<p>CentOS Overview</p>

			<p>CentOS is an Enterprise-class Linux Distribution derived from sources freely provided to the public by a prominent North American Enterprise Linux vendor.&nbsp; CentOS conforms fully with the upstream vendor&#39;s redistribution policy and aims to be 100% binary compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork.)&nbsp; CentOS is free.<br />
			<br />
			CentOS is developed by a small but growing team of core developers.&nbsp; In turn the core developers are supported by an active user community including system administrators, network administrators, enterprise users, managers, core Linux contributors and Linux enthusiasts from around the world.<br />
			<br />
			CentOS has numerous advantages over some of the other clone projects including:&nbsp; an active and growing user community, quickly rebuilt, tested, and QA&#39;ed errata packages, an extensive&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=15">mirror network</a>, developers who are contactable and responsive, multiple free support avenues including<a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=8">IRC Chat</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=16">Mailing Lists</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/">Forums</a>, a dynamic&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/smartfaq/">FAQ</a>.<br />

			The CentOS team is pleased to&nbsp;<a href="http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-announce/2013-March/019276.html" target="_blank">announce</a>&nbsp;the immediate availability of CentOS 6.4 for i386 and x86_64 architectures.<br />
			<br />
			CentOS 6.4 is based on the upstream release EL 6.4 and includes<br />
			packages from all variants. All upstream repositories have been combined into one, to make it easier for end users to work with.<br />
			<br />
			There are some very important changes to this release compared with the previous versions of CentOS and we highly recommend reading this announcement along with the&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS6.4" target="_blank">Release Notes</a>. Especially take a look at the &quot;Known Issues&quot; section.&nbsp;<br />
			<br />
			There is also a minimal install CD that will get you a very small base install that you can add to.<br />
			<br />
			And now: Have fun.<br />
